          <h2> Promoting the Surface family </h2>
          <p> I have demonstrated a pitch of a mini-roadshow for my peers. The roadshow was about the Surface Pro and how to 
              take notes on OneNote using the Surface Pen. </p>
          <p> I have used OneNote to take notes in the class since last year, and I have found that it is very effective and convenient 
              to use OneNote on the Surface Pro, especially with the Surface Pen. Having the ability to mark down some of the important
              points on the lecture slides or draw some illustrations greatly enhanced the usability of OneNote. However, I felt that not
              many of my peers are using OneNote, let alone Surface. Therefore, I took this opportunity to show my fellow students some of 
              the notes that I have taken in the class and have them tried using the Surface Pen on OneNote. </p>

          <figcaption>Some of the notes that I've taken using OneNote.</figcaption>
          <p> During the mini roadshow, some of my classmates tried using the Surface Pro and also tried OneNote. To their surprise, the
              experience of using the Surface Pen was so natural, with 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity, the Surface Pen was able to accurately 
              record even the slightest change of stroke and showed it on the screen. After the roadshow, I have also asked some of the students about
              how they feel about the Surface product, and one of the students said that aside from the surprisingly excellent build quality, the
              combination of the Surface Pen and OneNote impressed him the most. And nearly all the students agreed that with the help of this kind of 
              technology, there is no longer the need to carry pens and paper to the classroom for taking notes. </p>
